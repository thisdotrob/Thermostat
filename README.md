# Makers Academy Week 5 - Thermostat

Week 5's pairing challenge was to build a simple mock thermostat in JavaScript and jQuery, using data retrieved from the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api), test-driven using Jasmine.

## Specification
We were given the following requirements:
```
- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with the up button
- You can decrease the temperature with the down button
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 by hitting the reset button
- The thermostat should colour the display based on energy usage - < 18 is green, < 25 is yellow, otherwise red
```
